# Python Class Scheduler
## GUI EDITION

This is a GUI version of a previous Python project of mine. 

The application is simple:

1. Class names are provided by the user. 
2. Available times for each course are selected
3. The scheduler generates every possible schedule and displays them in a QT Table Widget.

Gone are the days of using an old excel spreadsheet to plan out your college schedule. It would take me hours! 

Automate the boring stuff.
